However, those who had recently come into power showed a certain degree of leniency. By chance, our companion Socrates was accused by some powerful individuals and brought before the court for a crime that was most unjust and least of all applicable to Socrates himself.

And the laws and customs were corrupted and distorted to an astonishing degree, so that when I saw the common good being pursued, and observed these things happening everywhere, I was filled with dread, and did not wish to turn away from considering them so that something better might come about regarding these things and indeed the entire state. But to act, I always waited for opportune times, and when they occurred, I made use of them to the best of my ability, and when they did not occur, I observed closely the fact that all cities nowadays are governed unjustly, because their laws nearly always lack some necessary provision, and there is no wonder-working chance to provide them. And so I am forced to speak in praise of true philosophy, since it is only through this that one can perceive what is just in politics and in all private affairs.

For associating with Dion at that time, I exposed myself to new dangers, speaking and advising what seemed to me best for men to do, but not realizing that I was inadvertently planning the downfall of a tyranny. And as for Dion, because he was very intelligent in all matters, both in general and in particular those that I advised him on at that time, he obeyed me very sharply and eagerly, more than any young man I ever knew, and he wished to live the rest of his life quite differently than most of the Italians and Sicilians, having chosen virtue over most pleasures and other forms of luxury.
